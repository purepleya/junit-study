## 2.2 Definitions
### Lifecycle Method
@BeforeAll, @AfterAll, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach

### Test Class
Test class 는 abstract 여서는 안되며, 단 하나의 생성자(constructor)를 가져야 한다.
1. 최상위 class
2. static member class 
3. @Nested 로 정의되고 테스트 메소드를 하나이상 가지고 있는 class

## 2.3 Test Classes and Methods
Test methods and lifecycle methods may be declared locally within the current test class, inherited from superclasses, or inherited from interfaces (see Test Interfaces and Default Methods). In addition, test methods and lifecycle methods must not be abstract and must not return a value (except @TestFactory methods which are required to return a value).

Class and method visibility
Test classes, test methods, and lifecycle methods are not required to be public, but they must not be private.

It is generally recommended to omit the public modifier for test classes, test methods, and lifecycle methods unless there is a technical reason for doing so – for example, when a test class is extended by a test class in another package. Another technical reason for making classes and methods public is to simplify testing on the module path when using the Java Module System.

The following test class demonstrates the use of @Test methods and all supported lifecycle methods. For further information on runtime semantics, see Test Execution Order and Wrapping Behavior of Callbacks.
